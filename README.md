# 🧠 YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection 🚀  
**Author**: Krishna Tripathi  


## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates a **real-time object detection system** using [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and OpenCV. It detects common objects (bags, bottles, laptops, etc.) from webcam input in real-time with high accuracy and optimized performance — even on CPU-based systems.

This is my **first solo computer vision project**, built from scratch to explore model integration, live inference, and performance optimization.
